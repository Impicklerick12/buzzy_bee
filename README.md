The goal of this project is to work in a team of two for the Coder Academy Hackathon.

We chose to build a flappy bird style game. The mechanics/functionality are the most important, but if we have time
visual will be included.

Game Mechanics:
Mouse clicking will keep the bird/player character from falling due to gravity.

Goal:
Avoid falling to the ground and the obstacles you fly through as you move from the left to the right side of the screen.

Sounds:
Sound can be included towards the end after main game is complete.

Visual:
Basic colours to begin followed by pixel art/retro.
