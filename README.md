## Buzzy Bee - Overview<br>
This was our entry into the Coder Academy Hackathon, it won 3rd place.<br>
We chose to build a flappy bird style game as it offered simple mechanics and a single input to play.

**Timeframe & Date**<br> 
21st-23rd Sep 2020

**Controls**<br> 
Spacebar to flap/fly up.

**Goal**<br>
Try and fly for as long as possible whilst avoiding the ground and vine obstacles.

**Sound**<br>
Due to our understanding prior to the hackathon, there is currently no sound feature in the game.

**Visual**<br>
The images used were all sourced online, and unfortunately we're unable to give credit to the original creators. If you believe any of these images to be works of your own, please feel free to get in contact so we may give credit where it's due.

**Known issues/Bugs**<br>
- You must refresh the browser to play again after game over.
- The vine collisions are not perfect.
- There is no instruction of how to play. (press spacebar!)
- Vines appear squashed and stretched.
